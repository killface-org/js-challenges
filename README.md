# Javascript Challenges

### Setup
```shell script
git clone https://github.com/killface-org/js-challenges.git
cd js-challenges

### Challenges

Each challenge is located in the `challenges` directory, with filenames corresponding to the challenge number. 
For example the first challenge is named `c1.js`. Instructions for completing the challenge are in the comment at the 
begging of the file.
