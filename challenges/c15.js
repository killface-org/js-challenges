/*
Vigenere Cipher.

The purpose of this challenge is to implement the routines for encrypting and decrypting input with the Vigenere Cipher.
In the real world our requirements may come in the form of implement algorithm per spec. So, you can find the details
of how this algorithm works here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher. Just as in the previous challenge
you must maintain case and ignore any characters that are not in the alphabet.

You will ned to implement two function in this challenge vigenereEncrypt and vigenereDecrypt. Each function will take
two parameters the first is the input string to encrypt, and the second is the passphrase.

Examples:

Call: vigenereEncrypt('The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dogs.', 'password')
Returns: 'Ihw Iqwtn Qrgoj Tfa Yueho Cmhg Tzw Hoqb Soyk.'

Call: vigenereDecrypt('Ihw Iqwtn Qrgoj Tfa Yueho Cmhg Tzw Hoqb Soyk.', 'password')
Returns: 'The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dogs.'

Notes:

You can create more than one function in your solution, as long as both function exist and return the correct results
then the tests will pass.
