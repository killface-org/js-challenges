/*
Let's create an Array.

Create a function called makeArray that takes one parameter. When called the function should return an array that
is the length of the input parameter, and each value in the array is also the value of the first parameter.

Examples:

Call: makeArray(1)
Returns: [1]

Call: makeArray(3)
Returns: [3,3,3]
